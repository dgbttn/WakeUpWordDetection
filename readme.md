# Detect Wake Up Word 

## My project in Speech Processing Course

Record your voice and run Coccoc application whenever you say "Coc coc" in real time


## How to use
- run "generate_train_set.py"
- run "train_model.py"
- run "demo.py" and it will start record your voice


## Note
- Edit the location of application you want to run when say "Coc coc" in "demo.py" (row 127)
- It will take a long time to generate train set and train the model, if you just want to test my code, you can edit the number of train sets in "generat_train_set.py" (row 73), 100 is ok
- 1000 train sets are not enough for high accuracy, try a bigger number!


## How to build a program for other wake-up-words
Coming soon
